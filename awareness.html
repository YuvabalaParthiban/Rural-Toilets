  <p>Toilet use is crucial to unlocking social and economic progress in India, and to save the lives of thousands of children.<br>

-> At the moment, 564 million people, that’s just under half the population in India, do not yet use a toilet.<br>-> Instead, they go out in the open in open fields, railway tracks, garbage dumps, parks and roadside ditches.<br>-> This is incredibly dangerous, as exposure to human waste causes diarrhoea and other diseases that can be deadly, especially for children.

<br>-> In 2015 it was estimated that 2.4 billion people globally had no access to improved sanitation facilities.<br>-> Of them, 946 million defecate in the open. Of these 564 million live in India.

<br>-> In rural India, where 61% of the population defecate in the open, it is practised among all socio-economic groups.<br>-> In urban India, 10% of the population practice open defecation. More than half the children living in slums in Delhi don’t use toilets.

<br>-> Ending open defecation is not just about access to toilets it’s about generating demand for toilets and getting everyone to use them every single day.<br>-> Open defecation is an age old practice that is seen as ‘normal’ in many communities.<br>-> ROTO is a website to create a new normal where everyone understands the importance of toilets and uses them.

         <h2>WHY TOILETS ARE IMPORTANT</h2>
        
         <p><br>-> Toilet use is essential to the survival and development of all children in India and around the world, as exposure to human waste causes diseases such as diarrhoea.

<br>-> Every day, almost 400 children under five in India die due to diarrhoea because of poor sanitation and hygiene.<br>-> India has the highest number of diarrhoea related deaths among children under five worldwide. Diarrhoea and other sanitation related diseases can prevent children from being able to absorb the nutrients in their food, leading to undernutrition.


<br>-> The simple act of handwashing with soap before food and after defecation cuts diarrhoea disease by 40%.<br>-> For women and girls, sanitation is important for their health, safety and dignity.<br>-> For women and adolescent girls, toilets provide a space to manage their menstrual hygiene, and are an important measure in lowering the risk of harassment when defecating in the open around dusk and dawn.
<br>-> Toilet use is not just important for the health of children, but for national progress. <br>-> According to the World Bank, poor sanitation causes India economic losses amounting to 6.4% of India’s GDP in 2006 or USD 53.8 billion (Rs. 2.4 trillion) per year, which is equivalent to USD $43 for every Indian per year.

<br>-> Toilets are essential for clean, and healthy communities and contribute to the social and economic development of India.</p>
